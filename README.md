# ML-BrainTumorDetection
Machine Learning Model for Brain Tumor Detection
# Machine Learning - Brain Tumor Detection
#### dataset source - Kaggle

- Data samples in the beginning        - 4600 units
- Data samples after cleaning the data - 4461 units

#### After the Data Cleaning:
- 2421 samples with brain tumor and the other 2040 without.
- All samples resized to fixed size and convert to gray HOG images.

### Models Tested:
- Logistic Regression
- KNN Classifier
- SGD Classifier

### Choosing Model:
The Suitable Model was the Logistic Regression with Training Accuracy (Avg.) of ~0.95 
which was close to the other two models.

### The Logistic Regression Test Results had 96.19% of Accuracy.
